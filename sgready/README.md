# SG-Ready

Theis plugin allowes to create an SG ready interface based on 2 GPIO pins connected to a SG-Ready heat pump.

The GPIO need to be connected to the SG ready interface of the heat pump.

> Note: take care to configure the correct pins for relay 1 and 2. Connecting them over cross will lead to missbehaviour of your heat pump.
